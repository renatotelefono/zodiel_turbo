# The World (21) – Reversed

The World reversed symbolizes delays, obstacles, and incompleteness. When it appears upside down, it indicates that a cycle hasn’t yet closed or that something is preventing you from reaching the full potential of a project or phase of life. You may feel close to a goal without quite achieving it, as if the last step toward fulfillment were missing.  
This card invites you to reflect on which inner blocks or external situations are keeping you from the wholeness you desire.

## Meaning in the Present  
In the present, The World reversed indicates a sense of frustration or stagnation. You may feel you’ve worked hard without seeing the full result, or that you’re in a transitional phase lacking clarity.  
This card invites you to take stock: what internal or external obstacles are keeping you from completing the cycle? At times they’re unconscious fears; at others, unresolved external influences. Only by addressing these knots will it be possible to open up to a new phase of fulfillment.
