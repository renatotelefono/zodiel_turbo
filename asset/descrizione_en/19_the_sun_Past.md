When The Sun appears in the past position, it recalls a moment when you experienced joy, accomplishment, or great inner clarity. You may remember periods of success, moments of family harmony, or happy relationships that nourished your spirit.  
This card suggests that those bright experiences strengthened your trust in yourself and in life, creating a foundation of optimism that still supports your actions today. Recognizing that positive past helps you remember that authentic happiness is born from the balance between heart, mind, and mindful action.
