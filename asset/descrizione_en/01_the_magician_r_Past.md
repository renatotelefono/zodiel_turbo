If The Magician reversed appears in the past position, it recalls a time when your abilities were not fully used or were diverted toward unconstructive goals. You may remember moments of hesitation, unfulfilled promises, or decisions influenced by illusion.  
This card, while highlighting mistakes or distractions, carries a message of awareness: every experience of disorder or manipulation can become a lesson for better managing your resources in the present.
