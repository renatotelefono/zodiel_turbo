In the present, The Sun reversed indicates that you may be close to success or a happy phase, but something is slowing its arrival or reducing its intensity. Perhaps you’re doubting yourself or allowing external influences to overshadow your enthusiasm.  
This card invites you to cultivate trust, gratitude, and optimism. Even if the light isn’t yet at full strength, the Sun is still there: finding joy in small things and recognizing the progress you’ve made can rekindle your vital energy.
