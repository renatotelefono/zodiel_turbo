When The Magician appears in the past position, it recalls a moment when you discovered or successfully used your abilities. It is the memory of a brilliant beginning, of a project or idea that made you feel in control of circumstances. It often indicates periods when you took the initiative to act, transforming situations in your favor.  
Reflecting on this past helps you recognize your inner strength and ability to create opportunities. The experience lived with the Magicianâ€™s energy continues to nurture the present, reminding you that self-confidence is the key to every achievement.
